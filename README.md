ct-jquery-supports
==================

User-agent based detection for features not detected by Modernizr

__Please note: this plugin is optimised for internal Chrometoaster use. YMMV.__

## Installation

1. In Terminal: `cd /PATH/TO/PROJECT-THEME-FOLDER`
1. `bower install https://github.com/chrometoasters/ct-jquery-supports.git#v1.0.0 --save`

Note: if you wish to customise where Bower puts installed components, you may add a `.bowerrc` file into this folder:

        {
            "directory" : "PATH/TO/COMPONENTS"
        }
